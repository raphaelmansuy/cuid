  Collision-resistant ids optimized for horizontal scaling and binary search lookup performance.
  
  Currently available for Node, browsers, Ruby, .Net, Go, PHP and Elixir. This is the swift version
  
  Cuid().gencuid() returns a short random string with some collision-busting measures. Safe to use as HTML element ID's, and unique server-side record lookups.
